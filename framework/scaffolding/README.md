The initiation of the scaffolding process is accomplished through the use of the create command, which leads to the establishment of several directories, specifically src, conf, data, log, and docs. The src directory is allocated for the storage of source code, whereas the conf directory is reserved for configuration files relevant to the executable. The data directory is designated for the data utilized by the executable, the log directory is responsible for preserving a record of the executable's operational history, and the docs directory is intended for documentation-related materials.

For instance, one may navigate to the FENGSim/starter directory and execute the subsequent commands. 

``` 
	cd FENGSim/starter
	mkdir test
	cd test
	./../../framework/scaffolding/create
```
